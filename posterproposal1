### Summary This paper examines the difference in effect between long-term and short-term environmental enrichment (EE) on cognition, locomotion, and mood-related behavior by studying the behaviors and hippocampal gene expression in groups of mice treated by EE. It finds that both long-term and short-term EE can be beneficial to depressive symptoms as well as locomotion and that short-term may be anxiety-inducing and have a negative effect on locomotion in threatening situations.
